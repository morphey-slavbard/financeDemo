npm install eas-cli@latest -g
```

## Introduction to Expo SDK 50

[Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

```
You don't need macOS to build an iOS app with Expo, you only need an iOS device to run the Expo Go app.
For your development machine, Windows, Linux, and macOS are all supported.
```

## Install & Usage

- `npm install` -- To install all required dependencies
- `npx expo start` -- After you create a new project, use this for starting the server.
- `npx expo client:install:android/ios` -- Installing Expo Go client on iOS Simulator, Android emulator or directly to phone.
- `npx expo r -c` -- Starting project with clear cache.
- `eas build:configure/android/ios` -- New way of cloud building your application.

## Usage with Expo Client App

Expo Client enables you to work with all the [Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) in React Native, as well as the [JavaScript APIs](https://docs.expo.dev/) that they are bundled with the Expo App.

Expo Client supports running any project that doesn't have custom native modules added.

- Download the "Expo Client" app from the Play Store or App Store.
- Start your project with Expo
  - Install the CLI `npm i -g expo-cli@latest`
  - Start the project `npx expo start`
- Open the project:

  - Sign in to expo and the project will appear in the app.
  - Or point your phone's camera at the QR code in the terminal (press "c" to view it).
